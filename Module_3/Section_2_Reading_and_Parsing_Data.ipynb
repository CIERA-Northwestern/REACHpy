However, in data-driven science, you'll likely have to work with large sets of data that can come in a variety of formats: comma-separated values, tab-separated values, space-separated values, to name a few. Sometimes specific quantities can come in strange formats depending on the meaning, for example, a list of times might be formatted in hours, minutes and seconds, like this: 10:03:20. Whatever format your data might come in, you must be able to read in that data and separate it into more easily processed components that you can then analyze. That's exactly what parsing data means.\n","\n","## 2.1 Reading Data From a File\n","\n","The first step is to learn how to use Python to directly read data from a file. Let's say we have a data file called `planet_data.txt` containing the solar system planet names and their masses, that looks something like this:\n","\n","| Planet name        | Mass ($10^{24}$ kg)  |\n","| :----------------- | :------- |\n","| __Mercury__       |   0.330  |\n","| __Venus__         | 4.87  |\n","| __Earth__         | 5.97  |\n","| __Mars__          | 0.642  |\n","| __Jupiter__       | 1898 |\n","| __Saturn__        | 568  |\n","| __Uranus__        | 86.8  |\n","| __Neptune__       | 102 |\n","\n","\n","To open and read this data file, we use the commands:\n","\n","```python\n","with open('planet_data.txt') as planet_file:\n","    data = planet_file.read()\n"," ```\n","\n","Here, `planet_file` is a file object, which is a kind of object that allows you to access and manipulate a user file. Once the file object is created (the first line of code), you can use this to reference the file, and access or manipulate it with functions such as read, readline, readlines, write, seek, and close.\n","\n","The second line reads the entire contents of the file. Notice that the first row is a comment explaining the meanings of the columns, which is helpful to anyone looking at the file.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Running in Google Colab?
