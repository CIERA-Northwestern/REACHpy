    "# Section 2.4 | Defining Your Own Functions and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced you to built-in functions and modules in Module 1. Remember that modules are really just separate files that contain code. Using built-in functions and modules can save you tons of time because it means you don't have to write every bit of code you need from scratch; not to mention, they help to keep your codes cleaner and more readable. But you can also define your own functions and modules in Python. That way, if you are using an equation over and over, you can simply define a function that you can refer to by name, rather than typing out the equation each time you need it. When you're developing a longer code, you break it down into separate modules, which just fancy language for breaking up your code into multiple files for ease of use and organization. \n",

    "A function is like a machine that takes something in and spits something out. Functions are defined using the keyword def and the name you choose for your function, followed by parentheses containing the parameters you need to pass through to your function. The function always ends with a return command. The general format is as follows:\n",

    "> &nbsp; &nbsp;     return my_object                               # this is what will be returned by the function\n",

    "Python offers just about any standard function you can think of, but sometimes your research will call for very specialized functions, that only you (and maybe a handful of other people) will need to use often. In these instances, you can build your own modules as separate Python programs and import them into other programs, just like you can with the built-in modules. For example, we might create a module to store common unit conversion functions. Let's say our module was called conversions.py - it might look like this:\n",

    "> - A function takes in parameters as input and returns a single object. The input and returned objects can be in any format you wish, from numeric or string values, lists, or arrays.<br>\n",
    "> - Making use of functions and modules helps you to keep your growing code base more readable and more organized, and saves you from having to re-code things over and over.<br>"
