        "\n",
        "So far, we have used Python lists as well as Numpy arrays to store and manipulate data, each of which have their place in a simple Python program. But there's an excellent (and very popular) Python package called Pandas that greatly facilitates handling comma separated value (CSV) files and other types of data files. The basic tool in Pandas is the DataFrame, which you can think of as a large table with built-in functions to process rows and columns, read and write to many different formats on disk, and interact with other DataFrames. One key advantage of pandas over other types of data storage is that it can easily handle data of many different types, including strings and numbers.\n",

        "\n",

        "Finally, note that code also included a comment with the units associated with this data. Units were not included in the column names to keep the column names short, which helps writing the code later on be much easier. As a reminder, it is good practice to label units in your code with comments to stay organized and to be able to share your code with others so they can easily understand it.\n",

        "A common format for data is called a CSV file for comma separated values. In a CSV file, each row contains the same amount of numbers, each separated by a comma. It's possible to use other \"separators\" as well. A commonly used one is whitespace, where some number of whitespaces (whether tabs or spaces) are used to separate different values in a row.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main ways to read such files in Pandas is to use `pd.read_csv()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "filename = 'path/to/file' # whatever the path to the file is\n",
        "\n",

        "There are several parameters for this function that merit discussion.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `sep`/`delimiter`: The separator to use. Defaults to `sep=','`. Another useful one is whitespace, which would be `sep='\\s+'`.\n",
        "*   `header`: Often, files will include a first row with a list of names. In this is the case, `header=0` will adopt those column names. \n",
        "*   `names`: If your file doesn't contain a header (or you don't like the names provided), you can supply your own list of names. If you pass a header in the option above, this parameter will be overwritten, so remember to use either `header` or `names`.\n",
        "*   `usecols`: If you don't want to read all the columns of a file (e.g. because of memory constraints) then you can pass a subset of columns to use. For example, if you wanted the first two and the fifth column only, then you'd use `usecols=[0,1,4]`.\n",
        "*   `comment`: It's common for files to be prepended with some number of lines telling you what the file contains and additional details. These lines will begin with some character or combination of characters so that when the computer reads them it's easy to tell which lines to ignore. One common choice is `comment=#`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important thing to keep in mind: the real world is typically much messier than we'd like. As a result, we don't always have all the information we want. So, it's common for real world data to have a lot of missing values. `read_csv()` will take care of this by filling in the missing values with `np.nan`.

        "```\n",
        "Ignoring what these mean for now, notice that in the middle of both rows, there are a lot of commas in a row. These correspond to five columns where either the data doesn't exist for one reason or another. Also, notice that the second row is shorter because it's missing two more values than the first row.
