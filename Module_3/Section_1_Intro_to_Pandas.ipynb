        "So far, we have used Python lists as well as Numpy arrays to store and manipulate data, each of which have their place in a simple Python program. But there's an excellent (and very popular) Python package called Pandas that greatly facilitates handling comma separated value (CSV) files and other types of data files. The basic tool in pandas is the DataFrame, which you can think of as a large table with built-in functions to process rows and columns, read and write to many different formats on disk, and interact with other DataFrames. One key advantage of pandas over other types of data storage is that it can easily handle data of many different types, including strings and numbers.\n",

While a NumPy 2D array can be thought of as a huge matrix of numbers, a DataFrame really is a table. Note that I could have put the units in the column names.
