    "# Section 3.2 | Code Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a functional code that's correctly doing everything it's supposed to, you can do several things to improve your code, which could make it run faster, and/or make it easier to modify or expand later. Quite often in data-intensive computational research, you are doing many, many calculations, that could take hours to days (or even weeks!) to complete. Following best practices for optimizing your code can shave off a fraction of a second on calculations here and there, which can add up to a significant amount of time saved over large calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Optimize Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimize Repeated Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most obvious ways to speed up your code is to minimize repeated computation. For example, let's say you have a list, nums1, containing n numbers, and you want to subtract the mean of the list from the elements of that list and store those elements in a new list, nums2. A concise way to do this would be to use list comprehension, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> nums2 = [r-sum(nums1)/n for r in nums1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that here sum(nums1) is a convenient way to compute the sum of all the elements in our list nums1, using Python's built-in list function sum(). Now, let's think for a second about what the above code snippet is doing. How many times is the mean sum(nums1)/n being computed? That's right -- n times. But the mean is a constant, so it makes more sense to first compute the mean and store the result in a variable so we can pull it out of the loop. This code snippet will do the same thing much faster:\n",
    "\n",
    "> m = sum(nums1)/n\n",
    "nums2 = [r-m for r in nums1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example: Consider the following calculation\n",
    "> y = x - x&ast;x/2. + x&ast;x&ast;x/3. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value x*x is computed twice (once in the second term and again in the third). Instead, this calculation will be faster:\n",
    "> xsq = x&ast;x<br>\n",
    "> y = x - xsq/2. + x&ast;xsq/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it were being computed just once, the difference wouldn't be noticeable, but if you were evaluating it for many different values of x, the time can really add up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below rewrite the following code to minimize repetitive calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "> a = range(1,10)<br>\n",
    "> [print(x&ast;a[0]&ast;x&ast;sum(a)) for x in a]\n"

    "## Timing Your Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all tricks for optimizing your code are so obvious. Luckily, there are ways to actually measure how long different operations take in Python. One such way is with the Python timeit module, which has three different functions (timeit, repeat and default_timer). The one we'll use here is timeit, but you should feel free to explore what the other functions can do for you. Note, you can use time snippets of code with timeit from the shell command line, in the iPython or the regular Python console, and in Jupyter, but they will look a bit different.\n",

    "The output tells you that your computer divided 100 by 5 a large number of times (10 million, for example), repeated that process three times, and then returned the best time in microseconds for those three trials. That's the minimum CPU time that your computer needed to carry out the division. Note that your computer does not take exactly the same amount of time each time it performs the same calculation, which is why the calculation is repeated many times. In fact, if you run this command several times, you'll find a bit of variation between each of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you write your code you have a choice whether to divide by a variable or to multiply with its reciprocal. Let's try replacing the division by 5 with a multiplication by 0.2 and see how long that takes:\n",
