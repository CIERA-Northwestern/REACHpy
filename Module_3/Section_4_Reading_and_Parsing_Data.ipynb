    "# Section 2.3 | Reading and Parsing Data From a File\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have been working with very short lists of data or generating your own lists of data. However, in data-driven science, you'll likely have to work with large sets of data that can come in a variety of formats: comma-separated values, tab-separated values, space-separated values, to name a few. Sometimes specific quantities can come in strange formats depending on the meaning, for example, a list of times might be formatted in hours, minutes and seconds, like this: 10:03:20. Whatever crazy format your data might come in, you must be able to read in that data and separate it into more easily processed components that you can then analyze. That's exactly what parsing data means.\n",

    "## Reading Data From a File\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to learn how to use Python to directly read data from a file. Let's say we have a data file called citydata.txt containing a few city names and their populations, that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "#CityName &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; Population<br>\n",
    "Chicago &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 2.704958e6<br>\n",
    "Seattle &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.04352e5<br>\n",
    "Dallas  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  1.197816e6<br>\n",
    "Philadelphia  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 1.567872e6<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To open and read this data file, we use the commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "> cityfile = open('citydata.txt')<br>\n",
    "> data = cityfile.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, cityfile is a file object, which is a kind of object that allows you to access and manipulate a user file. Once the file object is created (the first line of code), you can use this to reference the file, and access or manipulate it with functions such as read, readline, readlines, write, seek, and close. The second line reads the entire contents of the file. Notice that the first row is a comment explaining the meanings of the columns, which is helpful to anyone looking at the file. Python is smart enough to know that it should ignore that line when reading in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try it out\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the jupyter lab text editor, open a new text file named cityfile.txt, and copy and paste into it the four lines of city data. After saving and closing the file, type the commands above in the cell below, to first open, and then read the contents of the data file. Then print out the result of \"data\" - what type of object does it represent? "
