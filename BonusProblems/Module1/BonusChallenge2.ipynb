    "One of the most important relationships in astronomy is Kepler's laws of planetary motion, because they allow us to use orbits to calculate the masses of astronomical objects. Of particular use is Kepler's third law, which relates the period, separation, and masses of two objects:\n",

    "Here $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two bodies orbiting eachother, $P$ is the period of their orbit, and $a$ is the distance between them. In the case of our Solar System, because the mass of the Sun is significantly greater than the mass of any of the planets (i.e. $m_1 + m_2 \\approx m_1$), this can be reduced to:\n",
