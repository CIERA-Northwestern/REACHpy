    "Integers are exactly what they sound like: they hold whole numbers, and operations involving them and other whole numbers will always yield whole numbers. This is an important point in general programming, because variable types are not generally reassigned dynamically. So, for example, the operation 5/2 would yield 2 rather than 2.5 if 5 is an integer. In our case, however, we are using Python 3, which will automatically convert an integer to the next type of variable if the natural output is not a whole number, as below :"

    "A floating point variable is capable of holding real numbers. \n",

    "Why have different types of variables for integers versus non-integer real numbers? In mathematics there is no need to make the distinction, of course: all integers are real numbers, so it would seem that there should be no reason to have a separate type of variable to hold integers. However, this ignores the way computers work. On a computer, operations involving integers are exact: 1 + 1 is exactly 2. However, operations on real numbers are necessarily inexact. I say necessarily because a real number is capable of having an arbitrary number of decimal places. The number pi contains infinitely many digits, and never repeats, but my computer only comes with a finite amount of memory and processor power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even rational numbers (like 2/3) run into this problem, because their decimal representation (or to be exact their representation in binary) may be an infinitely repeating sequence. Thus it is not possible to perform operations on arbitrary real numbers to exact precision. Instead, arithmetic operations on floating point numbers are approximate, with the level of accuracy determined by factors like how much memory one wants to devote to storing digits, and how much processor time one wants to spend manipulating them. \n",
    "\n",
    "On most computers a python floating point number is accurate to about 1 in 10^15, but this depends on both the architecture and on the operations you perform. That's enough accuracy for many purposes, but there are plenty of situations (for example counting things) when we really want to do things precisely, and we want 1 + 1 to be exactly 2. That's what integers are there for.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also convert variable types. We can change the floating point `c` into an integer, which will drop the values after the decimal point. It will not round the value. "
