    "In the nineteenth century, this was a major question. Early astronomers assumed that the Sun's energy came from gravitational energy that was stored when a cloud of gas collapsed to form it. Let's estimate how much energy that would be. The gravitational energy of the Sun can be estimated from the following equation:\n",

The physics behind this equation is that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Mass can become energy and energy can become mass. Critically, for the Sun, this is exactly what happens when Hydrogen atoms undergo fusion to form Helium atoms. Let's check this. Look up the mass of the Hydrogen atom, and the mass of the Helium atom. Does four times the mass of the Hydrogen atom equal the mass of the Helium atom? Do your calculations below:"

Without anything powering it, the Sun will start to collapse in on itself, and eventually the density and temperatures get high enough to start fusing heavier elements into even heavier elements.
