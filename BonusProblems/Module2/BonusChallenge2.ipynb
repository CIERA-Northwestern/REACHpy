    "In the early 20th Century, astronomers made a surprising discovery about the Universe that we're going to explore here. Astronomer's were keenly interested in measuring the distances to \"spiral nebulae\" to understand whether they were a part of our galaxy, or extra-galactic (they would turn out to be extra-galaxies - separate galaxies on their own!), and at the same time were able to measure how fast those galaxies were moving towards or away from us.\n",

In this directory there is a file called \"type1a_sne.csv\" that has the measured distances (in units of kilo-parsecs) and velocities for a number of galaxies. Load those data in to two lists:"

The other comes from density fluctuations in the early universe when it was only 380,000 years old (cool!). Maybe there's some physics we don't understand creating the discrepancy. Or, maybe we are systematically measuring something incorrectly and we just don't know. Stay tuned!"
