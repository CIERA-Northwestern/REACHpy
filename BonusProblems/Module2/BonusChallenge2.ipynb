    "In the early 20th Century, astronomers made a surprising discovery about the Universe that we're going to explore here. Astronomer's were keenly interested in measuring the distances to \"spiral nebulae\" to understand whether they were a part of our galaxy, or extra-galactic (they would turn out to be extra-galaxies - separate galaxies on their own!), and at the same time were able to measure how fast those galaxies were moving towards or away from us.\n",
