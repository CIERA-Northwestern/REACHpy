    "\n",
    "__Why Should You Care?__<br>\n",
    "Before we get into what functions, modules, and packages are, lets talk about why you should care in the first place. Functions allow you to write a block of code that does something useful for you and then allows you to use it whenever you need it. When you create that block of code you can even improve on it when you learn new coding techniques, you can share it, and more! Modules and packages are examples of blocks of codes other people have written and shared. We will explore some common modules and packages in this notebook and later on in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Technical Description__:<br>\n",
    "One of the key selling points of using Python is its versatility. Python comes pre-packaged with many built-in modules and functions that are handy when doing computational research. These include tools for handling file input and output, performing operations on strings, performing standard mathematical operations and doing many other common things. One module you'll use frequently is the math module, which makes it possible for you to compute trigonometric functions, factorials and logarithms, as well as accessing special numbers, like pi and infinity. With Python, you've got just about everything you need at your fingertips!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly is the difference between a function, a module and a package?\n",
    "\n",
    "> - A function is a block of code that can be referenced and run from anywhere in your program<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a function as a machine that is built for a specific task or tasks. In Python, you build one of these machines with code. In Python, you can think of \"keyword arguments\" (also known as \"kwargs\") and \"arguments\" as the gears that compose our machines. We will explain these further when we look at an example of a function. Note: kwargs are a type of argument, but not all arguments are keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - A module is a text file that contains a number of functions and other items<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a module as a special type of machine that is already made for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - A package is a group of related modules<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you go through the course, you'll learn many more useful built-in functions, modules and packages. You'll also find that sometimes you need to define your own functions and modules to suit your specific needs, so we'll show you how to do that, too. To explore all the included functions in Python 3, check out the documentation __[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)__.\n",
