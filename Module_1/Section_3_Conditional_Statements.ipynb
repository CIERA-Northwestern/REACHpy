    "# 1.3 | Decision making in Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, the programs we have seen execute all the lines of the code from beginning to the end and then stop.  However, we often need to run some lines but not others by performing some decision making. Computers can jump around the program lines based on given criteria using  an `if` statement.\n",

    "## Decision Statements\n",

    "You can think of if statements as asking your computer whether something is True of False (these being the two \"Boolean operators\"). The basic comparison and logical operators in Python are written as follows: \n",

    "Comparison operators refer to mathematical comparisons such as greater than, less than, not equal to etc. Logical operators perform and, or, not (`!`) operators. The logical `or` operator returns True if either of the operands is true. The logical `and` operator, on the other hand, returns True if all of the operands are true. \n",
