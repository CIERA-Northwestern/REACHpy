Computers can execute only certain parts of a program using an `if` statement.\n","\n","## 1.3.1 Decision Statements\n","\n","The `if` statements ask your computer whether something is `True` of `False` (these being the two \"Boolean operators\"). The basic comparison and logical operators in Python are written as follows:\n","\n","\n","| operation            | syntax   |\n","| :-----------------   | :------- |\n","| __greater__          | `>`  |\n","| __less__             | `<`  |\n","| __equal__            | `==`  |\n","| __not equal__        | `!=`  |\n","| __greater and equal__| `>=`  |\n","| __less and equal__| `<=`  |\n","| __and__              | `and`  |\n","| __or__               | `or`  |\n","\n","\n","Comparison operators perform comparisons such as greater than, less than, not equal to, etc. Logical operators perform `and`, `or`, not (`!`) operators. The logical `or` operator returns True if either of the operands is true. The logical `and` operator, on the other hand, returns True if all of the operands are true.\n","\n","Note that checking for equality in Python uses `==`. Using a single `=` is reserved for assigning variables. We demonstrate the difference below:\n","\n","```python\n","T_sun = 5778.0 # here we assign the temperature of the Sun to 5778.0\n","\n","T_sun == 5778.0 # here we check if the temperature of the Sun is 5778.0\n","\n","```\n","Let's perform some conditional operators below:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IuIUmOyJjHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283659716,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"93b1f0b9-24f4-4124-83f0-b81aca6fc561"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["5778.0\n"]}],"source":["T_sun = 5778.0\n","print(T_sun)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-SVEZta3jHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283661734,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"c06478ea-e167-4b0f-882b-28aca52b52cc"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n"]}],"source":["print(T_sun == 5778.0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hlXYMcgpjHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283663049,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"4046dc19-4f02-4750-8584-6f8607d2d724"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["False\n"]}],"source":["print(T_sun == 6778.0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qvfWjjS4jHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283669518,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":206,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"e8f40c2d-bf5b-46a8-8939-22d60ac485bb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n"]}],"source":["print(T_sun != 6778.0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"n7RcU0XOjHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283670836,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"4758214e-b4d8-4a65-b5f2-6358a1fd9421"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n"]}],"source":["print(T_sun < 6778.0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ll-hcAjajHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283672731,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":233,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"86d4f031-6d5e-4653-99de-56c4fbbedcf3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n"]}],"source":["print(T_sun >= 5778.0)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uby10SkpjHEs"},"source":["Now, try out the following examples with logical operators:\n","\n","```python\n","print(T_sun > 4778.0 and T_sun < 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun > 4778.0 or T_sun < 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun == 4778.0 and T_sun < 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun != 4778.0 and T_sun <= 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun == 6778.0 or T_sun < 5778.0)\n","print(T_sun == 6778.0 or T_sun <= 5778.0)\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"OaE7tnv-jHEs","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710283687898,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":176,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"89a06386-1252-4697-acf1-19037db9375a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["True\n","True\n","False\n","True\n","False\n","True\n"]}],"source":["print(T_sun > 4778.0 and T_sun < 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun > 4778.0 or T_sun < 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun == 4778.0 and T_sun < 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun != 4778.0 and T_sun <= 6778.0)\n","print(T_sun == 6778.0 or T_sun < 5778.0)\n","print(T_sun == 6778.0 or T_sun <= 5778.0)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PhXQjvH8jHEs"},"source":["### 1.3.1.1 Components of an if statement\n","\n","An `if` statement typically has two parts:\n","- the condition (what is being checked each time), and\n","- the action (what is being performed if the condition is met).\n","\n","In general, an `if` statement looks something like this:\n","\n","```python\n","if <condition>:\n","    do something   \n","```\n","\n","There are two important rules while using an `if` statement in Python.
