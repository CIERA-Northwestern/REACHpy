        "\n",
        "Python is a computer programming language which allows you to perform mathematical calculations and visualize data. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is easy to learn, easy to read, and can accomplish complicated tasks with very few lines of code. Python has quickly become one of the most popular coding languages when computing in scientific and many other industries. Perhaps most importantly, there are many libraries (sets of pre-written functions) that have been developed for Python. Often, the best way to accomplish a coding task is to find a library that has already solved the task for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "But to be able to leverage all that Python offers, you must start with the basics. As you go through this course, you will be provided with many exercises to complete. Two very important points we want to make at the outset:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. When learning to code, it's important to actually do it! It's easy to simply look at code and say to yourself, \"yeah, that makes sense, I think I've got it!\" But seeing it and doing it are two very different things. Trust us!\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We obviously cannot cover everything in this course, so if there's ever something that you don't completely understand, or that you're interested in learning more about, look it up! Google things liberally and shamelessly, because there are tons of excellent Python resources out there. Reviewing different tutorials, examples, and forums will help you become familiar with the language more quickly.\n",

An example that would necessitate more precision would be the numbers that a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracks. If the system the GPS is being used in is not precise enough, there could be bad consequences! For example, consider a siutation where you had a bad GPS tracker that only kept track of distances rounded to the nearest 1000 meters to save on memory **and** you wanted to go to a movie theater that was 1500 meters away. Since your bad GPS tracker can only return a distance of 1000 or 2000 meters given its limitations, you can only get a location that is 500 meters away from where you actually want to be!\n",
