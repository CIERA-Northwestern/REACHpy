    "## The Importance of Precision\n",
    "__Why Should I Care?__ <br>\n",
    "Precision, in computer science or math, is a measure of the detail in which a quantity is expressed. We'll use a baking example to illustrate the importance of precision. You're baking a strawberry tart and the recipe calls for 1.75 ounces of chopped strawberries. However, when you start weighing your strawberries you find that your food scale only reads out ounces in increments of 0.5 ounces - so the scale could read out 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 ounces etc. This scale lacks the precision, or detail, to tell you the information you need. In this example it's not the biggest deal, you can just round up and have more strawberries! However, when measuring some more delicate, like flour, precision with your measurement could be the difference between a baked treat that is just right or too dense (i.e too much flour).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Technical Description:__ <br>\n",
    "Precision is a measure of the detail in which a quantity is expressed. In computer science, precision is typically measured in bits; in math or science, it's usually measured in decimal digits. As a scientist doing computational work, it's critical to pay attention to the types of numbers you're working with, or you may end up with incorrect results, or results that don't have high enough precision to accurately solve your computational problem. \n",

    "## Data Types in Python\n",
    "__Why Should I Care?__ <br>\n",
    "Date types dictate the amount of memory your computer is allocating to a give number. Since we are talking about allocating a limited quanitity - computer memory - you may have thought that precision may play a role in deciding what data type to use. You would be right! Precision often factors into a decision about what data type to use because different data types take up different amounts of memory. For example, if you were to use your python calculator from <a href=\"https://github.com/bueno646/CIERA-HS-Program-2021/blob/master/IDEASpy-Mike-Updates/Module_1/Section_1.ipynb\">Module 1: Section 1</a> to calculate your grocery bill you will likely not need numbers with more then 2 decimal points (e.g $3.55 for eggs). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "An example that would necessitate more precision, and therefore more precise data types, would be the numbers that a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracks. If the system the GPS is being used in is not precise enough, there could be bad consequences! For example, consider a siutation where you had a bad GPS tracker that only kept track of distances rounded to the nearest 1000 meters to save on memory needs AND you wanted to go to a movie theater that was 1500 meters away. Since your bad GPS tracker can only return a distance of 1000 or 2000 meters given its limitations, you can only get a location that is 500 meters away from where you actually want to be! Not ideal at all! \n",
    "\n",
    "__Technical Description:__ <br>\n",
    "Your computer represents all numbers in terms of sets of binary digits, or bits. Your computer hardware determines how many bits are available for and exactly how it represents different types of data. In many cases, you will not need to explicitly state a data type because Python will automatically assign a data type based on how you entered the data or value. Other times you may want to explicitly set the data type, for example, if you know that your value is going to grow with your calculations, and you want to ensure that there's enough storage space reserved to store the value to the required precision. Most real data applications will call for many different data types, from ints to floats, to strings, to lists and arrays (sequences of items - more on these later).\n",

    "Different kinds of numbers require different numbers of bits to store them. Also, as we saw in the first lesson, in some cases, the results of your calculations will differ based on the numbers' data types. Below we describe some of the most common data types in Python.\n"

The number 1. (with the dot, but without the zero) is also a float. Like integers, your computer likely reserves 64 bits for each float. Floats can also implement the scientific notation with an upper or lower case E representing the power of 10. For example, 4.6E17 would be interpreted as $4.6\\times10^17$.\n",
