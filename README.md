# REACH: Research Experiences in Astronomy at CIERA for High School Students

This is the GitHub repository for CIERA's REACH program. This repository is built on the [IDEASpy package](https://github.com/CIERA-Northwestern/IDEASpy), which is a beginner Python course tailored to those intereseted in scientific computing and data science. The course is presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and assumes no prior knowledge of Python. Each module introduces a new larger topic in Python, as well as at least one challenge set at the completion of module sections.

The modules cover the following topics:

IDEASpy was originally developed as part of the Integrated Data-Driven Discovery in Earth and Astrophysical Sciences ([IDEAS](https://www.ideas.ciera.northwestern.edu/)) Research Traineeship program supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DGE-1450006. However, any opinions, findings, conclusions, and/or recommendations are those of the investigators and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. It has since been modified for use by high school students with support from [Reach for the Stars](https://gk12.ciera.northwestern.edu/).

## Getting Started

These programs can be run through jupyter notebook on your local machine or Google Colab on a web browser. It is recommended you use Google Colab if you are uncertain about installing Python/Anaconda, or if this is for classrooms where software cannot be installed.

Follow these instructions if you want to run this on Google Colab. It is required that you have an email address that is hosted through Google in order to save you work for later.

1. In the table of contents above, click on the "Open in Colab" badge to open the notebook directly in Colab.

2. Click **Copy to Drive**

3. Make sure you work in this new copy if you would like to save your work!

To run locally, we will provide instructions using the **Terminal**. We generally recommend installing Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda. To install Anaconda on your local machine, please follow these instructions: [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Change directory to the preferred directory where you would like these notebooks stored
```
cd Path/To/Directory/
```

3. Clone this repository in the terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/CIERA-Northwestern/IDEASpy.git
```

4. Change directory to the IDEASpy directory
```
cd IDEASpy/
```

5. Change directory to the module of your choice. For example, for Module 1:
```
cd Module_1/
```

6. Start jupyter notebook with the desired section. For example, for Section 1:
```
jupyter notebook Section_1.ipynb
```

### Prerequisites

If you are using Google Colab or Anaconda, all the packages used in this program will be installed automatically. These include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

## Contributing / New Modules or New Versions for Different Audiences

As maintainers of this project, we would like to expand its reach to as many students as possible while maintaining its main purpose of introducing a variety of audiences to coding and Data Science through the use of Python. If you would like to use this project as a base for a more directed course, we politely ask you to let us know by raising it as an issue or emailing us at [IDEAS@northwestern.edu](mailto:IDEAS@northwestern.edu). There are two reasons for this:

1. It allows us to further understand its reach when reporting to funding providers or those interested in working with our research center.

2. If you develop material we are interested in adopting, we would like to open that collaborative channel in order to best further and improve the learning provided within this tutorial.
