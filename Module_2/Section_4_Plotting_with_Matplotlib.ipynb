    "# CIERA Summer Camp 2019: Plotting with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Getting Started with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a powerful 2D plotting library built for Python, and the package of choice for many researchers these days. Like Python itself, it's fairly intuitive and easy to get started, yet advanced enough to produce amazing, publication-quality figures. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and iPython shell, the jupyter notebook, as well as in other applications and toolkits beyond the scope of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, you should already have matplotlib installed. In your Python terminal, type import matplotlib. If you don't get any errors, you're good to go! If not, visit the matplotlib.org. Links to an external site for help on installing matplotlib on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Ways to Use Matplotlib\n",
    "There are essentially two ways to use matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Quick and dirty using pyplot: a collection of MATLAB-like (if you're familiar) plotting functions that allow for quick and dirty plotting. When you use pyplot functions, they are always acting on the 'current figure' which it keeps track of.<br>\n",
    "> 2. More fine-grained control through the Figure and Axes classes: an object-oriented approach for plotting<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people like to use the quick and dirty method for quick plots in jupyter notebooks, but it can be used in scripts as well. When you are making more complex plots, you may opt for the second approach. We will introduce you to both of these plotting styles because as you explore on your own, you'll encounter both types of examples. For a more in-depth conceptual overview of the matplotlib framework and hierarchy check out this page: \n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Basic Plotting with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will cover the basics of plotting with matplotlib, but there is much more to learn. In subsequent modules, we'll continue to explore the capabilities of matplotlib, but if you're itching for more, refer to the resources at the end of this page. Also, you might want to print out this handy __[cheat sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_Matplotlib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)__ from Data Camp and keep it at your desk as you learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important tip for learning matplotlib: when you need documentation on a particular matplotlib object, matplotlib's internal search function will often be much more helpful than a Google search.  The internal search engine can be found on the right-hand side of the matplotlib __[website](https://matplotlib.org/)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Approach 1: Pyplot\n",
    "If you have a list of x and y values, it is easy to make a simple **line plot** of them. See the example in the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line tells the notebook that you want to display any plots inline (i.e. inside the notebook). This is done with the function %matplotlib inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line in the below code cell imports the pyplot module from matplotlib and says that we will refer to the pyplot as plt. This gives you access to all of pyplot's functions, which can be called as plt.functionname."
