Others include things like the product or sum of all elements, the difference between successive elements, or the maximum and minimum values of an array (and their indices). Here are some examples:\n",

Stars have a lot of properties, such as mass, radius, composition, position in the sky, distance, etc. In these cases, it would be unwieldy to have many separate lists of numbers. Luckily for us, the NumPy array datatype is actually called an ndarray, where n stands for N and d stands for dimensions. In other words, our arrays can have any dimensionality we require! But for now, let's restrict ourselves to two dimensions, which will be sufficient for most of the use cases you'll run into here. Rarely, you might have three dimensions (for example, making a 2D animation or running a simulation of particles) and more rarely four or more, but luckily everything generalizes to higher dimensions.\n",
