H-R Diagrams plot the temperature of a star against how bright a star is (i.e. it's \"luminosity\"). They are tremendously useful for studying many aspects of stars because, as it turns out, different types of stars fall in specific places on an H-R Diagram.\n",

One way to nicely deal with this is to change the axes to a log scale. Make a new version of your above plot, but now reverse the x-axis and make both axes have a logarithmic scale:"

    "What do you notice about the stars in your H-R Diagram? The features you see in this diagram correspond to different types of stars, as you can see in the H-R Diagram shown below (_Note_: Double click on this cell to edit and remove the \"\\<!--\" and \"\\-->\" below to see the image). Each of these different types of stars correspond to interesting physics that happens at different points in the lifetime of stars. The \"main sequence\" is where stars live during the vast majority of their life, while they are fusing Hydrogen as a source of fuel. \"Giant\" stars are what you get when stars near the end of their lives. Though the exact physics is too complicated for this simple notebook (though do feel free to ask an instructor, if interested!), in short, stars near the end of their lives start burning a huge amount of fuel in a short amount of time, causing them to swell up and get very large and bright. But because they are so large, their surfaces also cool down some. Finally, white dwarfs are what is left over when a giant star can no longer hold on to most of this material at large radii when the star is swollen, and so is left with a super hot core. But because they are small (about the size of Earth!), they aren't very bright.\n",
