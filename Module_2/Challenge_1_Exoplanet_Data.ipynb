    "# Challenge 2 | Using Python to Analyze and Plot Exoplanet Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're an astronomer who studies exoplanetsâ€”planets discovered outside our Solar System. In the last several years, the Kepler telescope has provided a wealth of data on new exoplanets, not to mention the exoplanets detected previously with other methods and other telescopes. It's a gold mine of data to be explored by astronomers who want to better understand the properties of these planets, such as their sizes, masses, and orbital periods around their host stars. This is your playground!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Challenge you'll be working with a subset of exoplanet data to make a plot similar to the one shown below (Credit: NASA Ames/W. Stenzel). While astronomers have been finding exoplanets since the nineties, there has been a burst of new detections made possible by the __[Kepler Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html)__, which launched in 2009. The Kepler telescope detects planets in a special way called the transit method, whereby it monitors the brightness of stars, and watches for dips in the brightness that occur when a planet transits, or passes in front of, the star. While these brightness dips are incredibly small, Kepler can measure stars' brightness precisely to capture these transit events.\n",

    "\n",
    "There several other methods for detecting planets, and to date, all method combined, astronomers have detected more than 3500 confirmed exoplanets!\n",
    "\n",
    "The __[Open Exoplanet Catalogue](http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/)__ is a catalogue of all discovered exoplanets, and is available to the public and can be accessed from your browser or downloaded from Github. For this challenge, we've collected a sample of exoplanet data that you'll use to explore the sizes and orbital periods of a subset of these exoplanets. \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this challenge, you'll do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Create and work with Python lists<br>\n",
    "> - Read in and parse data to put it into a useful format<br>\n",
    "> - Define your own functions and modules, which helps you to keep your code readable and organized<br>\n",
    "> - Create simple plots using the plotting package matplotlib<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you'll be working with a set of exoplanet data to study the radii and orbital periods around the host stars for a subset of exoplanets that have been discovered over the years. We'll need to read in the data from a file, parse the data to extract what we need, write a function to do some unit conversions, and make a couple of plots. We'll guide you through creating your starter code."
