    "## Why Numpy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (often pronounced \"Num-pie\") is a widely used module that is optimized to efficiently execute a variety of mathematical operations. Numpy will be extremely useful for your budding career as an astronomer because of everything it can help you do - read in and manipulate large amounts of data, quickly do simple or complex math, and much much more. While using Numpy, you will be working with  on objects called __\"arrays\"__. Arrays are similar to lists, with some key differences. Lets go over the differences between arrays and lists\n",

    "## Lists vs Arrays; Why use arrays instead of lists?\n",

Since both store data, but arrays allow you to do math on numerical elements, we will think of arrays as turbo charged lists."

You will also use conditional operators (from [Module 1: Section 4](https://github.com/bueno646/CIERA-HS-Program-2021/blob/master/IDEASpy-Mike-Updates/Module_1/Section_4_conditional_statements_and_loops.ipynb)) to check each if each data point is positive. If the data point is positive, we will add this index to a list (this list will be empty to start). We will then use that list of indices to only access the __positive__ values in our data - since the negative values are errors from our instrument."
