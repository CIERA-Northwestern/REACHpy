    "There's also a subtle but important point to notice here, which is the meaning of the equal sign. In mathematics, the statement that `a = b` is a statement that two things are equal, and it can be either true or false. In python, as in almost all other programming languages, `a = b` means something different. It means that the value of the variable a should be changed to whatever value b has. Thus the statement we made `a = a + 1` is not an assertion (which is obviously false) that a is equal to itself plus one. It is an instruction to the computer to take the variable a, and 1 to it, and then store the result back into the variable a. In this example, it therefore changes the value of a from 4 to 5.\n",

The first one causes the computer to forget whatever is stored in a and replace it by whatever is stored in b. The second statement has the opposite effect: the computer forgets what is stored in b, and replaces it by whatever is stored in a.\n",

    "You should always keep in mind that ***cells within a Jupyter notebook can be executed and reexecuted in any order*** as this can sometimes get you into trouble. This feature is the reason why an executed code cell is numbered, so that you know what order the cells you see have been executed in. Note that this does not have to be linear from the top to the bottom of the document, but can jump around within it. Often, you will note a mistake or something that you want to try and will go back and change the code in an earlier cell. If you reexecute just this one cell, then any already executed cells that rely on variables defined in the reexecuted cell or its output will ***not*** be automatically updated.  \n",
