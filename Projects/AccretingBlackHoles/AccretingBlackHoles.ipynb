        "\n",
        "Binary star systems consist of two stars that orbit one another. Depending on the mass of these stars, one or more of them may explode in a supernova and form a black hole late in their lifetime. This is generally the case for stars with initial masses greater than 20 times that of the sun, or 20 solar masses ($M_\\odot$).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the majority of these binary systems, black hole formation occurs asynchronously. This implies that the binary undergoes a period time where one object is a black hole and one object is still a star. This stage of evolution is called the x-ray binary phase, and the system is referred to as an **x-ray binary**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we call these systems x-ray binaries? During this evolutionary stage, the black hole accretes matter from its companion star due to its strong gravitational pull. The accretion process heats transferred material through gravitational and frictional forces, which in turn triggers the emission of x-rays. Below is a helpful illustration of this process:\n",
        "\n",
        "![HMXB_illustration](https://github.com/CIERA-Northwestern/REACHpy/blob/main/Projects/AccretingBlackHoles/HMXB_illustration.jpg?raw=1)\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the matter surrounding these black holes emits brightly in the x-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum, x-ray observatories (such as the Chandra Observatory) search for this emission to identify binary systems that house black holes. The brightness, or luminosity, that astronomers observe in these binaries is called the **accretion luminosity**, as it is the luminosity that results from the accretion process of stellar material onto the black hole. These observations help astronomers learn about the properties of these systems and predict their possible courses of evolution. For example, some astronomers are interested in finding systems like these that will eventually form colliding black holes, which can be observed with gravitational wave detections.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we will take a closer look at how we can predict the luminosity of these black hole systems using computational methods and data from simulations.  Theoretical calculations like these help astronomers target their observations towards certain luminosities so that they can better identify these systems in the sky. These calculations also help astronomers compare their theoretical predictions with observations so that they can better understand if there are flaws in their theoretical or observational methods."

        "As it turns out, black holes are not necessarily entirely dark!\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, black holes that are being feed material are able to emit light by a process that we call **\"mass-to-energy conversion\"**. In this process, a black hole is able to *accrete* (that is, increase its mass) via an **accretion disk** that transports material from large distances all the way down to the edge of the black hole, near its **event horizon**. By being moved around, the material loses energy, which is released in the form of emitted light. Therefore, the amount of light emitted -- which we call the **accretion luminosity** $L_{\\rm acc}$-- must be proportional to the so-called accretion rate of the disk  $\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$. In order to fall into the black hole, the material loses *so much energy*, that this must be released at the expense of the material's own (rest) mass. This process literally converts mass into light!\n",
        "\n",
        "If we put it into equation form:\n",
        "\n",
        "$L_{\\rm acc} = \\eta \\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}c^2$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\eta$ is a scale factor which represents the **efficiency of mass-to-energy conversion**.\n",
        "\n",
        "As black holes evolve and increase their mass via accretion, their efficiency $\\eta$ is thought to increase as well (the reasons are beyond the scope of this project, but they have to do with the black hole being spun up as it grows in mass, and spinning black holes are more efficient at converting mass into energy than non-spinning ones). An approximate way to relate the evolving efficiency to the evolving black hole mass is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\eta = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\bigg(\\frac{M_{\\rm BH}}{3M_{\\rm BH,0}}\\bigg)^2}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Since mass is literally being converted into light, it turns out the the black hole doesn't get to eat all the mass that was originally fed to it from a large distance. Instead, the black hole only accretes the material that **was not** converted into light. Or, in equation form,\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\dot{M}_{\\rm BH} = \\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}(1 - \\eta)$$\n",
