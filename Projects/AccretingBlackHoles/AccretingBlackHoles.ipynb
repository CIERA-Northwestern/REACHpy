    "\n",
    "Binary star systems consist of two stars that orbit one another. Depending on the mass of these stars, one or more of them may explode in a supernova and form a black hole late in their lifetime. This is generally the case for stars with initial masses greater than 20 times that of the sun, or 20 solar masses ($M_\\odot$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the majority of these binary systems, black hole formation occurs asynchronously. This implies that the binary undergoes a period time where one object is a black hole and one object is still a star. This stage of evolution is called the x-ray binary phase, and the system is referred to as an **x-ray binary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we call these systems x-ray binaries? During this evolutionary stage, the black hole accretes matter from its companion star due to its strong gravitational pull. The accretion process heats transferred material through gravitational and frictional forces, which in turn triggers the emission of x-rays. Below is a helpful illustration of this process:\n",

    "Because the matter surrounding these black holes emits brightly in the x-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum, x-ray observatories (such as the Chandra Observatory) search for this emission to identify binary systems that house black holes. The brightness, or luminosity, that astronomers observe in these binaries is called the **accretion luminosity**, as it is the luminosity that results from the accretion process of stellar material onto the black hole. These observations help astronomers learn about the properties of these systems and predict their possible courses of evolution. For example, some astronomers are interested in finding systems like these that will eventually form colliding black holes, which can be observed with gravitational wave detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will take a closer look at how we can predict the luminosity of these black hole systems using computational methods and data from simulations.  Theoretical calculations like these help astronomers target their observations towards certain luminosities so that they can better identify these systems in the sky. These calculations also help astronomers compare their theoretical predictions with observations so that they can better understand if there are flaws in their theoretical or observational methods."
