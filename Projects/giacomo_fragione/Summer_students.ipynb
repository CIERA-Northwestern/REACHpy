    "An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System. The first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992. As of 8 June 2020, there are 3262 confirmed exoplanets, with more than 700 systems having more than one planet. The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone, where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life on Earth, to exist on the surface. The study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life. Rogue planets do not orbit any star. Such objects are considered as a separate category of planet. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions or more."

    "The calculation of the expected temperature of a planet involves a couple of subtleties. One is __albedo__, which is the degree to which a planet or moon reflects light without absorbing it. Earth reflects about $37\\%$ of light, whereas the Moon reflects only $12\\%$. More reflection leads to a colder planet. Another issue is the __greenhouse effect__. If radiation is trapped then the planet heats up beyond the temperature it would normally acquire. An obvious example is that of Venus. Finally, the temperature can vary substantially over the surface of a planet, as it is obvious from a comparison between Death Valley and Antarctica. Atmospheres smooth out the difference (compare the Earth with the airless Moon, where the mean daytime temperature is $380$ K and the mean nighttime temperature is $120$ K). Therefore, a planet such as Earth can have both \"habitable\" and \"uninhabitable\" spots on it simultaneously."
