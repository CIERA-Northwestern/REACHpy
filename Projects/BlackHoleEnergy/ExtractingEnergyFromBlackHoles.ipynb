The short answer is that while indeed, light can never escape a black hole, the regions immediately surrounding the black hole can be extremely bright. To compare, imagine dropping a rock off a tall building. The rock will move faster and faster as it falls, because it is gaining kinetic energy as its potential energy becomes increasingly negative. Accretion disks work much the same way, except the potential energy is lost as light, which we can then observe here at Earth."

For any amount of material with some mass $m$, the energy fundamental to it is given by the familiar form,\n",

    "Here, $c$ is the speed of light. We will call this quantity, $E_{\\rm rest\\,mass}$, the 'rest-mass' energy. Whenever you use fuel as an energy source, you are really extracting rest-mass energy from it. Consider a nuclear reactor, which uses nuclear fission to harness the rest-mass energy of heavy elements such as uranium. For every gram of fuel that you put into the reactor, you extract about 0.08% of the rest-mass energy. Written otherwise, the efficiency of nuclear fission in our nuclear reactors is roughly $\\epsilon_{\\rm nuclear} = 0.0008$. This is a really small number; yet, this is still far greater than the efficiencies of other energy sources that we use on Earth. "

But, energy is conserved - so as the orbital energy gets lower and lower towards the black hole, most of the energy is radiated as light. In consequence, as the ball of plasma makes its journey through the accretion disk and into the black hole, the energy released as light is (roughly) equal and opposite to the change in orbital energy,\n",

    "### Exercise 3: Extracting energy from black holes with jets\n",
    "As plasma falls into a black hole through an accretion disk, it drags magnetic fields down with it. Magnetic fields can't fall into the black hole, so as more and more material is accreted, the magnetic field surrounding the black hole becomes increasingly strong. You can picture these magnetic field lines as strings that thread the accretion disk, something like this: \n",
    "<img src=\"black_hole_bfield_parabolic.png\">\n",
    "We usually think of black holes in terms of their mass. But, they actually rotate, too. Black holes are so dense that as they rotate, they literally drag the spacetime that surrounds them, forcing everything that exists around them to rotate as well. This causes the magnetic fields, dragged in by the accretion disk, to wind themselves up, until they form a tight coil along the poles of the black hole. Here, you can see a three-dimensional example of this in a simulation, where the coiled magnetic field linse are seen escaping through the poles:\n",
    "<img src=\"jet_simulation.jpg\">\n",
    "These jets can propagate to extremely large distances. If they are harbored by supermassive black holes, which lurk at the centers of galaxies, these jets can even escape their host galaxy. This is an observation of such a jet, taken by the 'Very Large Array' radio telescope in New Mexico:\n",
    "<img src=\"t15_3c175_vla_rot.jpg\">\n",
    "You can think of these jets as nature's particle accelerators. If you throw an electron into the jet, it will be launched along the coiled magnetic field lines that form the jet, reaching velocities that are nearly as high as the speed of light. While the magnetic field lines accelerate these particles, they can only do so because the rotating black hole twisted up the magnetic field in the first place. So, the energy that goes into these jets is partially supplied by the black hole. This means that accretion disks don't just extract rest-mass energy from the fuel they supply, they can steal energy from the black hole, making them even better energy sources!"

There are two parameters that we are worrying about here, '$\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$' and '$a$'. $\\Phi_{\\rm BH}$ refers to the 'magnetic flux' surrounding the black hole, and is basically a measure of how much energy is in the magnetic fields. Conveniently, we already calculated this in the 'magnetic_flux' variable a couple cells ago. $a$ is called the 'dimensionless black hole spin', and is a measure of how fast the black hole is rotating. It has possible values from $-1 < a < 1$, where at $\\pm1$ the black hole is 'maximally rotating', and the sign determines the direction with which the black hole rotates. \n",

I would plot contour_x and contour_z on their own, and by eye decide when you should cut off their values. \n",

    "If you get $\\alpha$, compare to see the real value of $1.7$, and see if you got close. You can also plot your function on top of one of your plt.contourf plots to see if it looks like it traces the shape of the jet. \n",
