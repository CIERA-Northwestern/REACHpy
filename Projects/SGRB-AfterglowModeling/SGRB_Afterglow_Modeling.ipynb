    "In the 1960s, astronomers started detecting bursts of gamma-ray emission. The high energy flashes did not repeat and were randomly scattered across the sky. After much work, astronomers realized that these bursts of gamma-rays were coming from other galaxies. To produce the high energy $\\textbf{photons}$ (packets of light) that make up gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) a source with a lot of energy is needed! All of these clues led astronomers to believe that are the result of explosions in our universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRBs are not $\\textbf{isotropic}$ (spherically symmetric). In fact, much of the explosion's energy is focused along the two poles. The beam that the gamma-rays are accelerated along is referred to as the $\\textbf{jet}$. The structure of the explosion means that in order to detect a GRB we must be directly in the path of the GRB.\n",

    "## Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows\n",
    "\n",
    "Accompanying each GRB is a multiwavelength afterglow. Afterglows as produced by fast-moving ejecta from the explosion colliding with gas that exists in the space between stars. The relativistic (aka VERY fast) collisions between the ejecta and the gas produce what is called $\\textbf{synchrotron emission}$. Though we won't go into the mechanics of synchrotron emission here, it's important to know that it creates a $\\textbf{jetted multiwavelength afterglow}$. Below is a diagram of an top hat afterglow. In the far right part of the diagram, you see the explosion (jet) colliding with the gas (ambient medium) to produce an afterglow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"agjet.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying observations of GRB afterglows can teach us about the properties of the burst, including how dense the environment around the explosion is. Below are answers to questions you may have as you simulate afterglow lightcurves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What does multiwavelength mean?\n",
    "Multiwavelength means that light is emitted in more than one part of the electromagnetic spectrum (see the first figure!). An afterglow emits in the radio, the visible (hereafter called \"optical\") and the X-ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the multiwavelength components of the afterglow is important because our X-ray, optical and radio detectors are better at localizing sources than gamma-ray detectors. A better localization allows astronomers to study the host environment of the burst and build a better understanding of what precipitated the explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What is a lightcurve?\n",
    "A lightcurve is a plot of time (x-axis) vs brightness (y-axis). Lightcurves are a ubiquitous tool for studying time-domain astronomy. A lightcurve shows us if a source dims, brightens, or stays the same over time. For a steady source like a galaxy, a lightcurve will be flat. A supernova's lightcurve will rise quickly and then fall over time. The lightcurve of a variable star (a star which brightens and dims periodically) will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"varistarLC.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Short GRB afterglow lightcurves are most like supernova lightcurves.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is a jet and why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "A jet is a collimated source of relativistic emission. Among other things, a jet is characterized by it's opening angle and shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the shape and the opening angle of the jet determine if the afterglow will be detectable to an $\\textbf{off-axis}$ (not directly in the path of the jet) observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What does an afterglow jet look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question! The short answer is that astronomers don't know for sure yet but have many theories. The simulations we'll be using below allow the user to try out a few different jet shapes. These jet shapes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Top Hat Jet}$: flux concentrated equally across a narrow beam, outside of which no flux escapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Gaussian Jet}$: Similar to a top hat jet except a greater amount of flux is concentrated in the center of the beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Power Law Jet}$: Flux concentrated in the middle of the jet but decays as you move to larger viewing angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using $\\texttt{afterglowpy}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the Python package $\\texttt{afterglowpy}$ (Ryan et al. 2015, Ryan et al. 2019) to simulate multiwavelength afterglow (AG) lightcurves and match them to actual observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "From https://github.com/geoffryan/afterglowpy/blob/master/README.md:\n",

    "\n",
    "jetType can be:\n",

    "SGRB 050724 was the first short gamma-ray burst whose afterglow was detected in the X-ray, optical, near-infrared and radio parts of the EM spectrum. As time went by, astronomers started sampling the afterglows more frequenctly across wavelengths. Here, we will compare the multiwavelength observations from the 130603B with our lightcurves for different jet types. Data from Table 1, Fong, Berger, Metzger et al. 2013 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/780/2/118/pdf).\n",

As $\\texttt{afterglowpy}$ only accepts $\\nu$ values, you'll need to convert to frequency to calculate your multiwavelength afterglow lightcurves.
