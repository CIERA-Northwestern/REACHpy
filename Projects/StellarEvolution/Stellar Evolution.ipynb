Mark the stages of stellar evolution as points on your plots (e.g. `plt.scatter()`).__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-Main-Sequence (PreMS):\n",
    "    - This is where the MIST models start! The stellar models start as a cloud of gas collapsing under gravity. The central temperature $T_c$ and central density $\\rho_c$ both increase as the star contracts. Although $T_c$, $\\rho_c$ are extreme compared to quantities we encounter here on earth, they are not high enough to cause atoms to fuse together just yet.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS): \n",
    "    - ZAMS is when the core temperature and density rise high enough for hydrogen fusion to begin. Hydorgen fusion in the core generates thermal energy which provides pressure support pushing out against gravity, halting the collapse.\n",
    "    - Both $\\rho_c$, $T_c$ stop changing and remain stable during the MS. You will also see that the central hydrogen abundance just begins to decrease. _Note: ZAMS is the beginning of the MS so try and find the first time hydogren fusion begins!_\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Terminal Age Main Sequence (TAMS):\n",
    "    - The MS ends at the TAMS when central hydrogen has been burned through fusion into helium. This may leave a core of helium surrounded by a layer of hydrogen. You can find this part of the evolution by looking at the central abundance of hydrogen which should be depleted. You may also plot the central abundance of helium and see how it relates to the central abundance of hydrogen as a function of time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Red Giant Branch Tip (RGBtip):\n",
    "    - After a star ends the MS phase, it has converted its core of hydrogen into helium. However, the helium is not burning yet because $\\rho_c$, $T_c$ are not high enough to begin helium fusion. The hydrogen sitting ontop of the helium is hot enough to fuse and so fusion occurs in a shell around the core while the core contracts. Then the star will start to expand into its giant phase characterized by a sharp increase in luminoisty and radius and a modest decrease in effective temperature.\n",
    "    - This point may be hard to find! Don't worry if you can't find it 100% correct. If you are trying you may want to plot just the end of the evolution of the star after ~1.1e10 years.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. White Dwarf Cooling Sequence (WDCS):\n",
    "    - A WD is the final stage of evolution for a solar type star. WDs are very dense objects that are made of mostly carbon and oxygen (or sometimes oxygen and neon). They do not fuse elements in their core to support themselves from gravitaitonal collapse. Electron degeneracy pressure provides the support they need meaning these objects are theoretically stable for the age of the universe if left undisturbed.\n",

To do this you will need to use the \"teff_val\" and \"lum_val\" given in the GAIA data. You will also need to make sure all the data are in the same units between MIST and GAIA!</p>\n",
    "  <p> <strong>(b.)</strong> Next you will change the stellar track you are plotting to match the cluster data. I have added code that marks the ZAMS location in every track as a black star on the plot. For a given cluster, find a stellar track such that the ZAMS location of the track in the HRD is at the peak of the Main Sequence band of the stars in the cluster. Then calculate the MS lifetime of the track. (ZAMS is at index `201` in the tracks and TAMS is at index `453`) </p>\n",

    "You may have noticed that the color magnitude diagram and the HR diagram look very similar and this is because they are closely related. Absolute magnitude and luminoisty are both measuring the absolute brightness of a star. Color and effective temperature are related by the radiation physics of stars (if you are interested, we see that stars emit [black body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation)). The image below shows stars from the Hipparcos and Gliese Catalogue of nearby stars in a plot with axes of an HRD and CMD.\n",

    "The final part of Exercise 2 is meant to show how stars of different masses evolve on different time scales. Higher mass stars evolve more quickly than low mass stars. If we considered a cluster of stars with many different masses ranging from low to high we might see the first plot in Exercise 2 (e.) where all the stars are still on the main sequence. However, at later times the massive stars have evolved and ended their lives as WDs while low mass stars are essentially unchanged and still on the main sequence. This behavior is known as the [**main sequence turn-off**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnoff_point). By finding the most massive star in a cluster still on the MS you can estimate the lifetime of the cluster!\n",
