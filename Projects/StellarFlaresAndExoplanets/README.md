`fiducial_flare` is a package for generating a reasonable approximation of the UV emission of M dwarf stars over a single flare or a series of them. The simulated radiation is resolved in both wavelength and time. The intent is to provide consistent input for applications requiring time-dependent stellar UV radiation fields that balances simplicity with realism, namely for simulations of exoplanet atmospheres.

For this balance of simplicity and realism, the flares generated are idealized in the spectral and temporal distribution of their energy through the following assumptions:

- The energy budget of the flares is constant. It was compiled by Loyd et al. 2018 and is given in "relative_energy_budget.ecsv".
- The NUV continuum is taken to be a 9,000 K blackbody with energy scaled against the Si IV doublet per the energy budgets of Hawley et al. 2003.
- Some strong but unobserved lines are assumed to show the same response (relative to quiescent levels) as a proxy line with good observations and a similar formation temperature. Specified with the notation "unobserved line -> proxy," these are
  + Lya core -> O I 1305
  + Lyb -> O I 1305
  + Lyg -> O I 1305
  + Mg II 2796, 2804 -> O I 1305
  + Al II 1670 -> C II 1334,1335
  + O VI 1031,1037 -> N V 1238,1242
- The temporal evolution of flux is taken to a be a boxcar followed by exponential decay, following the formula given in Loyd et al. 2018.
- Flare energies are distributed as a power-law based on the fit to M dwarf Si IV 1394,1403 flares of Loyd et al. 2018.
- The flare rate is constant.
- Flare events follow a Poisson distribution (implying an exponential distribution in flare waiting times, e.g. Wheatland 2000)

To maintain comparability between works that use input generated by this package, we will attempt to minimize future changes and document any we do make well.

### Tips
#### Units
`fiducial_flare` relies on the `astropy.units` module to ensure unit consistency, which some users might not be familiar with. In `fiducial_flare`, all dimensional quantities must be `astropy.units.Quantity` objects, i.e. numbers with units. These can be formed by simply multiplying a number by a unit from the `astropy.units` module. For example, to specify a time of 100 s, simply do

```
from astropy import units as u
t = 100 * u.s
```

Sometimes `Quantity` objects don't play nicely with `numpy`. This tends to result in some awkward usage of `x.value` (to get the float value with no unit), where `x` is a `Quantity`.

For more information on units with `astropy`, see [the docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/) for the `units` module.

#### Integration
Be aware that `fiducial_flare` integrates over spectral and temporal bins to ensure that energy is conserved when bins are changed. In contrast, it is standard practice for many to compute spectral density or rates at the midpoint of a wavelength or time bin. `fiducial flare` integrates the value over the bin and divides by the bin width to give the average value.

### Example Use

#### Quick(ish) Start
```
import numpy as np
from astropy import units as u
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.ion()
from fiducial_flare import flare_simulator as flaresim

# Let's look at a flare with an equivalent duration of 1 Ms occuring 100 s after the start of observations
eqd = 1*u.Ms
t0 = 100.*u.s

# first, a look at a well-resolved lightcurve
tbins_lc = np.linspace(0, 3000., 1000)*u.s
y = flaresim.flare_lightcurve(tbins_lc, t0, eqd)
plt.figure()
plt.step(tbins_lc[:-1], y, where='post')
plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('Quiescent-Normalized Flux')
plt.title('Lightcurve')

# let's get a spectrum from the impulsive phase and a few integrating
# intervals of the decay phase
tbins_spectra = [100., 660., 900., 1300., 2500.]*u.s
names = ['Impuslive', 'Decay 1', 'Decay 2', 'Decay 3']

# show these on the lightcurve plot
[plt.axvline(t.value, color='r', alpha=0.5) for t in tbins_spectra]
tmids = (tbins_spectra[:-1] + tbins_spectra[1:])/2
for tmid, name in zip(tmids, names):
    plt.annotate(name, xy=(tmid.value, 0.5), xycoords=('data', 'axes fraction'),
                 ha='center', va='center', rotation='vertical')

# now let's get some spectra
wbins = np.arange(912, 5000., 1.) * u.AA
spectra = flaresim.flare_spectra(wbins, tbins_spectra, t0, eqd)

# and plot them
plt.figure()
for spectrum in spectra:
    plt.step(wbins[:-1], spectrum, where='post')
plt.yscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Wavelength [$\AA$]')
plt.ylabel('Flux Density [erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ AA$^{-1}$]')
plt.legend(names)

# Aside: An important parameter is the quiescent Si IV flux, as this determines
# the absolute fluxes of the flare. A default value (based on an Earth-equivalent
# instellation from GJ 832) is supplied. That value is
print flaresim.flare_defaults['SiIV_quiescent']
# but for now we've just used the default.
