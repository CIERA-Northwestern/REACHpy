GENERAL BACKGROUND\n","\n","\n","An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System. The first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992. As of 8 June 2020, there are 3262 confirmed exoplanets, with more than 700 systems having more than one planet. The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone, where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life on Earth, to exist on the surface. The study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life. Rogue planets do not orbit any star. Such objects are considered as a separate category of planet. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions or more."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fEfrree2NVzC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PzeXlJ7R_dhk"},"source":["## 1.

An obvious example is that of Venus. Finally, the temperature can vary substantially over the surface of a planet, as it is obvious from a comparison between Death Valley and Antarctica.

From a purely scientific point of view, we can only estimate how many exoplanets can host life, as we know it.\n","\n","#### 1) How many of the currently known exoplanets are in the habitable zone?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kPa0H1Kn_dhk","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719355803300,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"1c91d07c-b3c9-4767-ec28-80733744995e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["115"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}],"source":["#Pick water habitable zone\n","rin = func_r(func_L(data['MSTAR']), 373)\n","rout = func_r(func_L(data['MSTAR']), 273)\n","\n","good = (rin < data['A'])&(rout < data['A'])\n","np.sum(good)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["good_df = data[(rin < data['A'])&(rout < data['A'])]\n","good_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":826},"id":"3winJNyugh-T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719355803300,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Kierstin Sorensen","userId":"10364973724080746689"}},"outputId":"3d39521d-8afb-4fee-b8a6-d430e01ba19e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                     NAME      MSINI         A          PER       ECC  \\\n","61             HD 24040 b   4.021890  4.924060  3668.000000  0.040000   \n","99    MOA-2009-BLG-387L b        NaN  1.768080  1970.000000       NaN   \n","111              GJ 649 b   0.325341  1.131790   598.300000  0.300000   \n","120            HD 38529 c  12.260300  3.600200  2146.050300  0.355094   \n","157            HD 42012 b   1.612100  1.661080   857.500000  0.000000   \n","...                   ...        ...       ...          ...       ...   \n","3155          HD 131664 b  18.328200  3.170980  1951.000000  0.638000   \n","3168          HD 147018 c   6.593550  1.922740  1008.000000  0.133000   \n","3186          HD 114613 b   0.506039  5.310900  3827.000000  0.250000   \n","3192             GJ 628 d   0.024382  0.470207   217.186363  0.552796   \n","3220          HD 106252 b   6.959130  2.611470  1531.000000  0.482000   \n","\n","            OM            T0   K  \\\n","61    154.0000  2.454308e+06 NaN   \n","99         NaN           NaN NaN   \n","111   352.0000  2.452876e+06 NaN   \n","120    17.9023  2.452256e+06 NaN   \n","157    90.0000  2.455386e+06 NaN   \n","...        ...           ...  ..   \n","3155  149.7000  2.452060e+06 NaN   \n","3168  226.9000  2.455301e+06 NaN   \n","3186  244.0000  2.455550e+06 NaN   \n","3192  260.8710  2.456173e+06 NaN   \n","3220  292.8000  2.453398e+06 NaN   \n","\n","                                                 ORBREF  \\\n","61                                          Boisse 2012   \n","99                                         Batista 2011   \n","111                                        Johnson 2010   \n","120                                         Wright 2009   \n","157                                            Rey 2017   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","3155                                        Moutou 2009   \n","3168                                     Segransan 2010   \n","3186                                    Wittenmyer 2014   \n","3192  Astudillo-Defru 2017 (corrected; private commu...   \n","3220                                    Wittenmyer 2009   \n","\n","                                                 ORBURL              FIRSTREF  \\\n","61    http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...545A...
