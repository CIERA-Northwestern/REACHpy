We know from Newton's laws that the gravitational force depends on the distance between two objects, the masses of both objects, and the gravitational constant $G$. So, you guess think that the formula for the orbital period must include $G$ and the two masses, as those are the two other pieces of information missing here, which is absolutely correct!

However, we still have one last detail to iron out: what units are we using? It is extremely convenient in these kinds of simulation to work in units where $G=1$ (as opposed to its SI value). Then, based on this we can choose units for two of the mass, distance, and time, and use the formula above to solve for the third. In this example, we will work with masses in units of the mass of the Sun ($1\\, M_\\odot \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^{33} \\,\\, \\rm{grams}$) and distances in astronomical units, roughly the semi-major axis of the Earth with respect to the Sun ($1\\, \\rm{au} = 149,597,870,700\\,\\,\\rm{m}$ by definition)**.

Then, using the acceleration and velocity at one time, we can find the new velocities and positions of all particles after a time $t$. The key point here is that the velocity of the particles will constantly be changing direction and magnitude, so we need to use a combination of short timesteps and clever algorithms to make sure everything goes well.

        "The previous exercise hinted at a fundamental reason why there are so many different kinds of codes to do different things. All codes are written to work well under specific conditions. If these conditions are broken, then the results may be complete nonsense. A one size fits all approach to the problem of gravity may be too slow or computationally intensive. In this case, the algorithm we're using, WHFast, is optimized for studies of systems similar to the Solar System, where there are many planets but their orbits stay roughly constant for all time and there are no close encounters. For this reason, Rebound comes with several integrators. One of them, IAS15 is meant to be as general as possible and does not rely on near-constant orbits. Instead of adopting a smaller timestep to achieve precision, the integrator uses adaptive timestepping. When velocities are large, timesteps are small. When velocities are small, timesteps are large. The main downside, among others, is that this may result in very long integrations. But, so does using very small timesteps.\n",
