A typical value for $\\kappa_{\\nu}$ is $\\sim 0.1$ cm$^2$/g, so that is also a reasonable value to use. $\\nu$ is the frequency of light that the picture was taken with, which happens to be 33 GHz. You'll need to look up the distance to the Taurus Molecular Cloud Complex. $B_{\\nu}(T)$ is the \"blackbody function\". Rather than trying to program this yourself (it's complicated), you can use the blackbody_nu function in the astropy package: https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.modeling.blackbody.blackbody_nu.html#astropy.modeling.blackbody.blackbody_nu."
