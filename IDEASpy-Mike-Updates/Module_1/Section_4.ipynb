    "# 1.4 | Decision making and Repitition in Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "__Motivation:__<br>\n",
    "Decision making and repitition in coding capture some of the most powerful aspects of coding: we can have computers make the decisions we want them to over and over again. Lets use an example to motivate this. Say you have 1000 stellar temperatures that are evenly spread accross all stellar types - so there are roughly the same number of temperatures that correspond to O type stars as B type stars, and so on. Lets say you wanted to just look at the hottest stars - O type stars. Instead of combing through your data set one data point at a time, you can use Pythons decision making and repitition functionality! You can tell Python to take your data set of 1000 stellar temperatures, have it look through each data point, and only return a variable containing steller temperatures greater than 30,000 K (roughly the cut off for a star to be an O type star) in miliseconds! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "We've briefly covered input, output, and calculations, but often we need our code to perform some decision making, just like we have to do each day in real life (if it's cold outside, take a coat; if it's warm, leave the coat at home). These statements come in the form of \"if statements\" which can range in complexity (for example, some applications might call for several, or \"nested\", statements).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of if statements as asking your computer whether something is True of False (these being the two \"Boolean operators\"). The most common type of numerical questions or checks that you'll be doing are the comparison operators, >, <, and ==, so we'll cover those as well __(note that since the single = is reserved for assignment of variables when checking for equality, Python uses ==)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: You will often hear the term \"conditional statement\" used to refer to decision statements in most coding languages, including Python. We will use this terminology for most of the content in this notebook and in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: You will often hear the term \"comparison operators\" used to refer to mathematical comparisons such as greater than, less than, not equal to etc. The corresponding symbols for less than and greater than, respectively, are < and >. The corresponding symbols for \"less than or equal to\" and \"greater than or equal to\", respectively, are =< and >=. The corresponding symbol for equal to and not equal to, respectively, are == and !=.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: At first glance, it might be tempting to assume that the way python checks for equality (\"==\") and the way it assigns a variable (with \"=\") are the same or interchangeable. Here are examples that highlight the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Example of assignment:<br> \n",
    "> price_of_apples = 1.42                     \n",

In just about every difficult computational problem, you're going to have to repeat some combination of calculations over an entire set of interesting data.\n",

For loops iterate over a fixed list of items, performing a certain set of calculations on each item (for example, computing the final grade for every student in a class roster). While loops perform an action while a provided condition is true (for example, you can make a code that add 1 to a variable originally set to zero until that variable is equal to 10). We will focus on for loops in this class. <br>\n",

    "### Quick introduction: Lists\n",
    "You may remember the analogy used to discuss variables in [Module 1: section 1](https://github.com/bueno646/CIERA-HS-Program-2021/blob/master/IDEASpy-Mike-Updates/Module_1/Section_1.ipynb). We likened variables to a box with a label. Here is a quick example we will use for this introduction on what lists are:<br>\n",
    "> - apple_price = 1.0<br>\n",
    "here, \"apple_price\" is the label and the computer is the box that stores the information we have assigned to it, \"1.0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are similar to variables, only instead of storing information in a labeled box, you can think of lists as storing information in a row of lockers ([visual example](https://previews.123rf.com/images/elfachero3/elfachero31803/elfachero3180300002/97960122-row-of-tan-school-lockers.jpg)). Each locker within the row of lockers has a position (e.g the first locker) and the ability to store information. Similarly, __lists__ consist of ordered individual items (\"elements\") that collectively make up the whole list. Lets look at an example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - example_list = [1,3,5,8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the language of our analogy, the label for this row of lockers is \"example_list\", there are 4 lockers (one for each element), and the items in the lockers are 1,3,5 and 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that lists are created on the __right__ side of the equal sign, as shown above. Brackets to the __left__ of the equal sign mean something different in python. We will explain this further in module 2, section 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why Should I Care?__<br>\n",
    "We can use the fact that lists can hold multiple pieces of information to our advantage! Specifically, we can use for loops to perform an action on every item in a list, as we will see in later examples in this notebook.\n",
    "For now, lets look at an example of how lists can store information in a more efficient way than making a bunch of variables. Instead of creating a bunch of variables for my grocery shopping desires, for example, I can make a list that houses all of my shopping items! See below:\n",
