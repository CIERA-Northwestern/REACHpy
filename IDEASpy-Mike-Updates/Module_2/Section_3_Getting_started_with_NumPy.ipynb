    "## Why Numpy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (often pronounced \"Num-pie\") is a widely used module that is optimized to efficiently execute a variety of mathematical operations. Numpy will be extremely useful for your budding career as an astronomer because of everything it can help you do - read in and manipulate large amounts of data, quickly do simple or complex math, and much much more. While using Numpy, you will be working with  on objects called __\"arrays\"__. Arrays are similar to lists, with some key differences. Lets go over the differences between arrays and lists\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists vs Arrays; Why use arrays instead of lists?\n",
    "The most important thing about arrays is that they allow you to do math operations on the whole array and/or also individual elements. We will demonstrate this utility later on! Below are some key similarities and differences between arrays and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Similarities:__\n",
    "\n",
    "> Both store multiple pieces of information <br>\n",
    "> You can store different types of information as elements within them (floats, strings, lists, etc) <br>\n",
    "> Both are indexed and iterated over identically to one another <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Differences__:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Arrays have to be created using Numpy, whereas lists are part of Python's libraries <br>\n",
    "> You can do math on numerical elements within arrays, but __not__ lists <br>\n",
    "> All elements in arrays __must__ be of the same type\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that in [Module 2: Section 1](https://github.com/bueno646/CIERA-HS-Program-2021/blob/master/IDEASpy-Mike-Updates/Module_2/Section_1.ipynb) we likened lists to a row of lockers. Since both store data, but arrays allow you to do math on numerical elements, we will think of arrays as turbo charged lists."

Similarly, basic arithmetic operations act elementwise on arrays, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Please note that array multiplication in NumPy is not matrix multiplication (aka dot product, but this can be done via the dot function. For two arrays a and b, these operations work as follows:\n",
