    "## 1.1 What is probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that you've come across probability in your daily life. The theory of probability entails the study of random events. While the origins of classical probability theory lie in studying games of chance, the study of randomness is now indispensible across all aspects of modern life.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's now time to be a little formal. When we analyze probabilities, e.g., what will happen when we roll a fair n-sided die, we consider what's called an event space. Every possible outcome of our experiment, i.e. rolling the die, lives in this event space. Now, we can write down some rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability of an event happening must be a positive real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The probability of any event at all happening must be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The probability of a set of certain events happening is a sum of the probability of each individual event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Working with Random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make this concrete by thinking about the case where we have a single six-sided die. Suppose we represent the total probability of rolling any number as a circle with area 1 (the second rule). Now, we know from geometry that areas can only be represented by positive real numbers (the first rule). We can then represent the probability of rolling the numbers 1 through 6 by dividing up the circle into 6 equal areas. Then, the probability of rolling, let's say, an even number can be found by adding the areas of the regions corresponding to rolling an even number (the third rule). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, we can imagine that we can simulate rolling our die by generating a random point in the circle and seeing where it lands. For example, if we had drawn this circle in the sand, we could carefully balance a stick on its end and let it fall to generate a random number. Of course, with computers, there's always a way to do this efficiently with a few lines of code. For this, we'll use the `random` module of NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42) # passing a seed is optional\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line of the above code, we generate what's called a `Generator` instance that will generate the random numbers for us. When creating this instance, we pass an optional seed to the function `default_rng` in order to make sure that our results are exactly reproducible. At first, this might come as a surprise since we're trying to work with random data. Can you think of a reason why we'd want our random data to be reproducible?"

    "In the previous exercise, in order to generate data, you chose random integers in a list. Typically, this is known as *drawing samples from a distribution*. In this case, each individual number you generated is a sample and the distribution is the list of integers that you were choosing from (i.e., in the case of a six-sided die, the numbers from 1 to 6). As one might expect, there are many different kinds of distributions. The distribution you have been using is called a *discrete uniform distribution*. It is called discrete because the range of possible values are countable and finite, and uniform because each value has an equal probability of being chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "As one might expect, there are many more distributions you could choose from. In particular, there are also continuous distributions, where the sample is chosen from a range of nonfinite values. One of the most common to use is the *continuous* uniform distribution, where the sample can take on the value of any real number** between two endpoints. If one were to plot this probability of being chosen, it would look like a straight line described by a function of the form\n",

NumPy has [a ton](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#distributions) of different distributions you can choose from. However, there are many more, so if you don't find what you are looking for, you might need to use a different library, such as [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html).

This distribution can be used to describe, for example, the distribution of wealth, where 10% of people in a country control 90% of the wealth. We will not go over the details of this distribution here, but if you continue studying astronomy, you will certainly see it again in the future.\n",

    "A statistic is a quantity that is computed from a set of data. There are many different statistics. Many of them are already familiar to you. The most familiar to you is likely to be the mean of data, which is the sum of all the data divided by the total number of data points. In statistics, the mean is often denoted with the Greek letter $\\mu$. This is the same $\\mu$ in the equation above. The other parameter, $\\sigma$, is the standard deviation of a distribution, which characterizes the spread of values around the mean. There are many others as well, such as the median, the mode, percentiles, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Calculating Statistics in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these operations are extremely common, there are [functions to compute them](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html) for a NumPy array. For example, to calculate the median and standard deviation of some array `a`, we can write the following code:\n",

    "4. Take the mean and standard deviation of the resulting 1d array. What is the relationship between your answer to 1 and the mean that you compute? Does this relationship make sense?\n",
    "5. Make a histogram of the 1d array with the kwarg `density=True`. Make sure to try to choose an appropriate number of bins.\n",
    "6. On the same plot as the histogram, plot the equation for the normal distribution above using the values you computed for the mean and standard deviation as the $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. To generate the x values for the distribution, use the minimum and maximum values of your array of sums.\n",

    "### 1.3.3 Practice Problem 5: Photons Escaping from the Sun\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at an example of a random walk. The radius of the Sun is about 696,000 kilometers. If a photon goes in a straight line from the center of the Sun, you would find that it would take about 2 seconds for the photon to reach the surface and escape into space. However, the reality is much more complicated than that. On its way to the surface, it will run into a bunch of atoms. In real life, the distance a photon can travel between these \"scattering\" events can be between a tenth and a couple centimeters. As a result, it can take hundreds of thousands to millions of years for a photon to go from the core to the surface, at which point it will escape into space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, photons travel in 3 dimensions, but we'll instead look at a 2 dimensional version of the problem. We'll also change some of the numbers. Doing this calculation with realistic numbers will take a long time with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a single argument `lambda`, which is the ratio between the mean distance traveled between scattering events and the radius of the Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways you could do this, the easy but slow way using `while` loops and the hard but fast way using vectorized numpy operations. Here I'll outline the version using a `while` loop and leave the other method as a challenge.\n",
    "1. Before the while loop, initialize the random number generator instance, radius vector $(0,0)$, and a counter to keep track of the number of steps.\n",
    "2. In the while loop, generate a random number between 0 and $2\\pi$ from a uniform distribution.\n",
    "3. Using that value of $\\theta$, generate the vector $\\delta r = \\lambda (\\cos\\theta,\\sin\\theta)$ and add that vector to the total radius vector.\n",
    "4. If the magnitude of the total vector is greater than 1, the `while` loop should end.\n",
    "5. Return how many steps it took for the photon to escape.\n",
    "6. Optionally, add a keyword argument for the maximum allowed number of iterations. If the number of steps exceeds this number, return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this function 1000 times with `lambda=0.01`. If you added the optional kwarg, then use `max_iter=300000`. Make a histogram of your results."
